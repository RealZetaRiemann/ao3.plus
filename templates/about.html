                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Ao3.plus is an extension of your Ao3 (Archive of Your Own) profile, created by Ronia Peterson, 
                    and inspired by <strong><a href="https://anime.plus/" target="_blank">malgraph</a></strong>.</p>
                <p>Ao3.plus takes a username and scrapes all the relevant information from that profile to create an assortment of word clouds, 
                    graphs, pie charts, etc. based on the user's bookmarks (saved works) and written works. 
                    Users can earn badges based on these parameters as well, which are designed to encourage users to read a wider variety of works, 
                    and write more of their own. Additional graphs and badges are always being designed and updated, and users can submit their 
                    own ideas for me to implement using the contact form.</p>
                <p>If you would like to see an example of what a profile on Ao3.plus looks like, feel free to use the example user profile 
                    <strong><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/ao3graph">ao3graph</a></strong>. Although, keep in mind that because this is an example profile, 
                    there are no published works linked to this account, therefore the "Works" page of ao3.plus will be blank.</p>
                <p>Ao3.plus is built with Python, Flask, and SQlite. Feel free to visit the <strong><a href="https://github.com/RealZetaRiemann/ao3.plus" target="_blank">git repo</a></strong> to view the source files.</p>
