Ao3.plus is an extension of your Ao3 (Archive of Your Own) profile, created by Ronia Peterson, and inspired by <a href="https://anime.plus/" target="_blank">malgraph</a>.

Ao3.plus takes a username and scrapes all the relevant information from that profile to create an assortment of word clouds, graphs, pie charts, etc. based on the user's bookmarks (saved works) and written works. Users can earn badges based on these parameters as well, which are designed to encourage users to read a wider variety of works, and write more of their own. Additional graphs and badges are always being designed and updated, and users can submit their own ideas for me to implement using the contact form.

Ao3.plus is built with Python, Flask, and SQlite.
